#ISIR Prewash
The ISIR Prewash program determines which Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) will be INSERTED into the database by checking a FAFSA SSN against the database, logically calculating the student's admission application decision or checking if the student had ever paid the matriculation fee.  If the SSN has an admission application decision of either Accept or Offer, or if the student had ever paid the matriculation fee, that FAFSA will be placed into a data file to be INSERTED into the database.
